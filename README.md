# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
### Applied Data Science Capstone

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for the **Applied Data Science Capstone**, the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The project focuses on applying data science methodologies to solve a real-world problem.

In this project, I took on the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup competing with SpaceX. Following the data science workflow, I collected, processed, and analyzed datasets, performed exploratory data analysis, visualized findings, built and evaluated predictive models, and reported results to stakeholders.

The goal was to predict whether the first stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket would successfully land. Using insights and models developed in this project, the startup can make informed decisions about competing in the space launch market. 

The repository includes:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis and visualizations
- Predictive modeling and evaluation
- Final project deliverables

This project demonstrates practical applications of data science, from data exploration to actionable insights.
